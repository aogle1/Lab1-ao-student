FizzBuzz
# AO FizzBuzz Lab1

This is a Lab1 Project for data structures.

# Learning Objectives

* Clone a git file, Then intialize in order to take the file and push to personal account.
* Succesfully set up and run FizzBuzz logic
* Refactor code to an array
* Refactor again to a list
* Re Push with every Refactor

# Methodology 
Implementation for the inital logic required setting up both a "Main" and "FizzBuzz" class while allowing for the "fizzBuzz" methods logic to be recognized by the "Main" class.

This code ran succesfully and was then refactored to an array [].

Finall the code was then changed to List<String> for a final succesful run. 

# System requirements

* Java 6 SDK or later
